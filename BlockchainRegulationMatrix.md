# Centralization Concerns and Risks in Blockchain Technology

This readme file outlines the various concerns and risks associated with centralization in blockchain technology. It provides an overview of government concerns, consumer risks, cons to over-regulation, cons to lack of regulation, and whether blockchain technology currently exists to fulfill these obligations.

## Government Concerns

- Electricity:
  - Protecting Consumers from loss of use
  - Amount of electricity required to maintain the blockchain and the amount per transaction
- Settlement Layer:
  - Not being able to update / edit fraudulent transactions
  - Not being able to identify immoral activity that could be deemed fraudulent behavior
- Node / Validator:
  - Not reporting income
  - Fault tolerant consensus
  - Decryption standards
- Consensus Layer - Computation Intensive Based:
  - Amount of electricity being used comparatively to similar technology that uses less electricity
  - Fault tolerant consensus
- Consensus Layer - Capabilities Based:
  - Upgrading consumer security standards
- Consensus Layer - Voting Based:
  - An anonymous public ledger inhibits appropriate recordkeeping
- On-chain Data Storage:
  - Storage space mapping
- Asset Layer - Stablecoins Only:
  - Stablecoins not being stable
  - Are stablecoins legally defined correctly
  - The effects of internal inflation based on the unlimited burning / minting mechanisms of popular stables
  - Does crypto transaction provenance equally replace not having serial numbers on government-released stablecoins?
- Asset Layer - Fungible Tokens - ERC20s, etc:
  - Mutability presents a scenario of being "derived from the efforts of others" which leans towards being a security
  - Consumer protection
- Asset Layer - Non-Fungible Tokens:
- Exchange Layer:
  - Not registering with FinCen or the SEC if selling securities
  - Being a vehicle for money laundering
- Protocol Layer:
  - Not being held accountable for any poor mismanagement or loss of consumer funds
- Application Layer:
  - No accountability
  - No business registration
  - No fiduciary liability
- Internet Browser:
  - International business
  - International dispute resolution
- Developer:
  - Why regulate the developer instead of the end product?
  - Is this a significant harm to the public currently being unregulated?
- Programming Language Auditor:
  - Auditors should have to be credentialed and up-to-date education
- DeFi Architecture Security:
  - How are people losing assets and why?
- Fiat onboarding / offboarding access:
  - Purchasing commodities in a non-KYC manner
  - Ability to offload blockchain assets to fiat comparably to other commodities
  - Consumer protection similar to purchasing stocks
  - Being front-run by the fiat/crypto intermediary

## Consumer Risks

- Asset Layer - Stablecoins Only:
  - Security of transactions
  - Centralization of tokens
- Asset Layer - Fungible Tokens - ERC20s, etc:
- Asset Layer - Non-Fungible Tokens:
- Exchange Layer:
  - Excessive transaction fees for the "new bank."
  - The only way to "save" your money in a "new bank" means you experience impermanent loss, there are no passive savings strategies
  - Interoperability in the DeFi stack
- Protocol Layer:
  - Not being held accountable for any poor mismanagement or loss of consumer funds
- Application Layer:
- Developer:
  - How can I protect myself without having to be a smart contract auditor?
- Programming Language Auditor:

## Cons to Over-Regulation

- Asset Layer - Stablecoins Only:
- Asset Layer - Fungible Tokens - ERC20s, etc:
- Asset Layer - Non-Fungible Tokens:
- Exchange Layer:
  - Limited access to tokens
- Protocol Layer:
- Application Layer:
- Developer:
- Programming Language Auditor:

## Cons to Lack of Regulation

- Asset Layer - Stablecoins Only:
- Asset Layer - Fungible Tokens - ERC20s, etc:
- Asset Layer - Non-Fungible Tokens:
- Exchange Layer: Inability for consumers to create securities in a regulated environment
- Exchange Layer: Lack of potential international economic growth
- Exchange Layer: Lack of security standards and risk management standards
- Exchange Layer: Consumer protection from upgradable  features
- Protocol Layer:
- Application Layer:
- Internet Browser: No specific support for social engineering through the browser
- Developer:
- Programming Language Auditor: No universal auditing & auditor education standards
- DeFi Architecture Standards / Auditor: Shoddy archictectural logic
- DeFi Architecture Standards / Auditor: Poor defi stack interopability
- DeFi Architecture Security:
- Fiat onboarding / offboarding access:
  - No specific support for social engineering through the browser

## Does Blockchain Technology Currently Exist to Fulfill These Obligations?

- Asset Layer - Stablecoins Only:
- Asset Layer - Fungible Tokens - ERC20s, etc:
- Asset Layer - Non-Fungible Tokens:
- Exchange Layer:
- Protocol Layer:
- Application Layer:
- Developer:
- Programming Language Auditor:
- DeFi Architecture Security:
- Fiat onboarding / offboarding access:
